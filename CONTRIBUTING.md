1. **Find an issue to work on:** Check the 'Issues' tab in GitHub repository and find an issue you're interested in working on.

2. **Fork the repository:** Click on 'Fork' at the top right corner of the page and clone the repository to your local machine. This will create a copy of the repository within your personal GitHub account, enabling you to propose changes.

3. **Create a new branch:** It's best practice to create a new branch for each new feature or bugfix you'll be working on. Not only is it proper git etiquette, but it also keeps your changes organized and separated from the master branch.

4. **Work on the issue in your forked repository:** Now that you're ready to contribute, start modifying the code on your forked repository. 

5. **Commit your changes:** After making your changes, commit them with a clear and concise commit message.

6. **Submit a pull request:** Navigate to your forked repository and click on 'New Pull Request' next to your branch, then 'Create Pull Request'. Ensure you provide a brief description of the proposed changes.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.

2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.

3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.

## Coding Style and Conventions

Use [Effective Dart: Style](https://dart.dev/effective-dart/style) as coding style guide for Flutter and Dart code. Also, use the flutter format as a code formatter.

Please make sure that your code follows these standards before submitting a pull request. You can use tools such as [flutter_lints](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_lints) package to automate this process.

## Testing and Debugging

Please write tests for your changes and make sure that they pass before submitting a pull request. You can run the tests locally with the following command:

```bash
flutter test
```
